        <h1>The joys of coding</h1>
            <p>
                Coding is not just science<br>
                Coding is art & experience<br>
                You can have issues and doubts<br>
                You can fail and feel a bit down<br>
                The search for bugs hurts like the thorns of a rose<br>
                The search for bugs also gives you purpose<br><br>
                When I code, I'm absorbed<br>
                When I code, all my problems are solved<br>
                Writing a good line makes my vivid<br>
                Writing a good line lets me free my spirit<br>
                Completing a project just feels rigth<br>
                Completing a project makes me thrive<br>
                Oh code, you help me ease my mind<br>
                Oh code, you make me feel alive<br>
                <br>
